            Carpets from India are famous for their high density of knotting.
            Hand-knotted carpets are popular in India and are a signature
            marking of Indian weavers. Since the 11th Century when carpet
            weaving was introduced into India, the industry has been growing and
            improving. Today Indian weavers are well known for their
            presentation of realistic attributes and their attention to detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            85% of the Indian weavers are women. The weaving career has assisted
            them with acquiring monetary independence and in this way, freeing
            them from the shackles of societal norms. Large numbers of our women
            weavers have become grassroots experts and have won many awards as
            designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carpetmantra focuses on the ideas and solutions that help in social
            wellbeing. We contact the grassroots-level experts and create many
            opportunities for making talented craftsmen in the carpet-value
            chain and getting sustainable livelihoods along with social
            development. Local financial and banking services (regular as well
            as inventive) are identified, and artisans are associated with these
            institutions for their financial growth.
